# [To-Do Guru](https://to-do-guru-ui.vercel.app/)


## Abstract:

[//]: <>

*To-Do Guru* is an application built to help anyone looking to divide and track chores among their household. To-Do Guru will build you out a weeks schedule of chores that you input and then it will assign them randomly to each member keeping the total duration for each household member as fair as possible. If you are tired of the weeks schedule you can hit the random button to build you out a new randomly curated weeks worth of chores.

## Preview of App:

[//]: <>
![]()

## Context:

[//]: <>

This application was completed as part of the Turing School of Software and Design Module 4 curriculum.  This app is a full stack application that was built with a backend team. We were tasked with implementing a new technology and chose to use GraphQL with Apollo for this application. Our time frame to complete was 2 1/2 weeks.

## Technologies Used:

[//]: <>
- React (JS, HTML, CSS)
- React Router for a multi-page interface.
- Cypress for E2E testing.
- GraphQL with Apollo
- CircleCI

## Learning Goals:

[//]: <>

- Demonstrate knowledge youâ€™ve gained throughout Turing
- Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software
- Gain experience dividing applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams. Service oriented architecture concepts and patterns are highly encouraged.
- Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing
- Practice an advanced, professional git workflow including a Pull Request Review
- Gain experience using continuous integration tools to build and automate the deployment of features
- Build applications that execute in development, test, CI, and production environments
- Focus on communication between front-end and back-end teams in order to complete and deploy features that have been outlined by the project spec
