## Context:

[//]: <>

This application was completed as part of the Turing School of Software and Design Module 4 curriculum. This was our capstone project which tested our mastery of everything we have learned during the 7 months we have been here. This app is a full stack application that was built with a backend team. We were tasked with implementing a new technology and chose to use GraphQL with Apollo for this application. Our time frame to complete was 2 1/2 weeks overall.

## Technologies Used:

[//]: <>
- React (JS, HTML, CSS)
- React Router for a multi-page interface.
- Cypress for E2E testing.
- GraphQL with Apollo
