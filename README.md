# [To-Do Guru](https://to-do-guru-ui.vercel.app/)


## Abstract:

[//]: <>

*To-Do Guru* is an application built to help anyone looking to divide and track chores among their household. A user is able to add chores to their household with the chore name, chore doer, and duration of chore. They are also able to add the household members that are doing chores. After that To-Do Guru will build you out a weeks schedule of chores and randomly assign them to each member while keeping the total amount of time on chores as fair as possible. If you are tired of the weeks schedule you can hit the randomize button to build you out a new randomly curated weeks worth of your chores. To-Do Guru is here to help keep your household running efficiently.

## Context:

[//]: <>

This application was completed as part of the Turing School of Software and Design Module 4 curriculum.  This app is a full stack application with a front end and back end team working together using agile workflow practices. We were tasked with implementing a new technology and chose GraphQL with Apollo for this application. Our time frame to complete was 2 1/2 weeks.

## Technologies Used:

[//]: <>
- React (JS, HTML, CSS)
- React Router for a multi-page interface.
- Cypress for E2E testing.
- GraphQL with Apollo
- CircleCI

## Learning Goals:

[//]: <>

- Demonstrate knowledge you’ve gained throughout Turing
- Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software
- Gain experience dividing applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams. Service oriented architecture concepts and patterns are highly encouraged.
- Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing
- Practice an advanced, professional git workflow including a Pull Request Review
- Gain experience using continuous integration tools to build and automate the deployment of features
- Build applications that execute in development, test, CI, and production environments
- Focus on communication between front-end and back-end teams in order to complete and deploy features that have been outlined by the project spec


## Wins + Challenges:

[//]: <>

### Wins:

- Implementing GraphQL with Apollo and connecting with BE for queries and mutations 
- Successfully completing MVP in a large team format of FE and BE developers
- Integrating CircleCI into our application

### Challenges:
